# DLNDF-Project-3

This is project submission for Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundations Course. 

This project involved create a TensorFlow model to generate artificial Simpsons TV Show Scripts.

Model was created using Recurrent Neural Networks using LSTM cell. 

The model generates non-sensical scripts because it is trained using just subset of dataset but can be improved with more data and training. 

The model is trained using <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/the-simpsons-by-the-data">Simpsons Dataset on Kaggle </a>
